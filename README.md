For a part of my 2nd year of degree (2016) I had to find a client to design and develop a website for.

Started by gathering the requirements and specification from the client, it was specified that client wanted a site to promote the shop.

I then went and created a site map of which I thought was the best way to organise everything the client wanted to include then designed the site by drawing out wire frames for each page.

I then started developing the site using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript & PHP while getting feedback from client after major work was done.

I designed, created the logo for the shop using Vector on Inkscape.

I developed a contact form for users to message the shop for any enquires.

Programmed a Slide show of images using JavaScript.

XML Site map styled using XSL.

Made it responsive mobile first site.

Using JQuery I have implemented a sticky footer which if the page is smaller then screen it makes the section expand to fill the gap making the footer stick to the bottom of screen.

Incorporated shops Facebook & Twitter feeds & Google Maps.

Installed Google Analytics on site with a cookie policy to let users know about this.

Made own custom error messages.
