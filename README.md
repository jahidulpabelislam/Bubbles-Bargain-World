# BubblesBargainWorld

For a part of my 2nd year of degree (2015/16) I was tasked to find a client to design and develop a website for. The client I had found had a local bargain shop and wanted a website for the shop.

Started by gathering the requirements and specification from the client, it was specified that the client wanted a site to promote the shop.

I then went and created a site map of which I thought was the best way to organise everything the client wanted to include then designed the site by drawing out wire frames for each page.

I then started developing the site using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript & PHP5 while getting feedback from client after major work was done.

#### Work done:
* Designed and created the logo using Vector on Inkscape
* Contact form for users to message the shop for any enquires
* Slide show of images using JavaScript
